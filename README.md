## Note
All of the exploits in the list are reverse engineered and some of them are highly obfuscated so I was not be able to deobfuscate there code's fully Including the DLL's(C++), so even though It's safe to use, use it at your own risk excluding the one's that is 100% though because there code are 100% readable If you decompile them.
